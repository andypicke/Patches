% run_eq14_for_PATCHES.m
%
% Modified version of run_eq14.m . Only difference is that it calls
% average_data_PATCH_AP.m instead of average_data_gen1.m . This computes
% all data for specified patches, instead of the normal evenly-spaced bins.
% Data paths also modified from Sally's version.

%
% run_eq14_AP.m
%
% Modified from run_eq14.m on 06/28/16 by A.Pickering.
%
% Same as run_eq14, but for chi calc use (1) no response correction and (2)
% differnt fmax in order to directly compare w/ chipod method.
%
% ** note I tried to pass in fmax to chi_calc_AP but couldn't get it to
% work, so have to manually change it for each run :( .
%
% Changes:
%
% 1) average_data_gen1 > average_data_gen1_AP
%
% 2) In average_dat_gen1_AP:
% calc_chi > calc_chi_AP
%
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%
% Adapting Sasha's processing from Dynamo11 for the eq14 cruise. The
% realtime processing doesn't go throuhg the cleaning and filtering steps
% that these codes do.
%
% By running this code it should process, combine, and clean all raw cham
% files. It calls functions: raw_load_cham2, cali_eq14, modify_header_eq14,
% fix_COND_eq14, average_data_gen1, set_filters_eq14, sum_eq14,
% tag_file_eq14, fix_summary_salt_eq14, make_mld, along with a lot of
% functions saved in mixingsoftware.
